^^^^^^^^^
1. Create a new folder with the name position-api-server.
2. Navigate inside the folder from the command line and execute the following command
   npm init -y
   This will create a package.json file inside your project.
3. Install the json-server npm package by executing the following command
   npm install json-server
4. Create a new file with the name .gitignore with the entry for node_modules inside it so the node_modules folder will not be pushed to  
   GitHub while pushing the code to the GitHub repository.
5. Create a new file with the name db.json and add the following contents inside it:
   {
  "position": [
    {
      "x": 9,
      "y": 9,
      "z": 9
    }
  ]
}
6. Open package.json file and add the scripts section inside it:
"scripts": {
  "start": "json-server db.json"
}
7. Start the application by running the npm start command from the terminal.
8. Now access "http://localhost:3000/position"
